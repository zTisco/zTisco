👋 Hi, I’m @zTisco, a passionate FiveM developer with a focus on Lua scripting.
👀 I’m interested in creating immersive and customized FiveM servers and game modes, combining creativity and technical expertise.
🌱 I’m currently expanding my skills in TypeScript and exploring new web development frameworks to improve both the front-end and back-end experience.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on FiveM projects, especially those involving server-side scripting, game logic, and custom UI integration.
📫 How to reach me: Feel free to contact me via GitHub or Discord.
😄 Pronouns: He/Him
⚡ Fun fact: I can write Lua scripts faster than you can load into a FiveM server!
